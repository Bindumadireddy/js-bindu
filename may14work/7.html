7. In the last example, we ended up with a long decimal number. We'd
like to round it off, but we don't know how to do that. The _Mozilla
Developer Network_ has excellent JavaScript documentation, and there
is a special _function_ called `Math.round` that will help us do
that. It would be worthwhile for you to read the documentation on this
function [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/round).
If you're feeling very brave, give it a try! You can round dollar amounts to two
decimal places by first multiplying by 100, then rounding the nearest integer,
then dividing by 100. You can divide by using the `/` operator.
