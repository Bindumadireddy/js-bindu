8. You may have seen HTML in the past, but in case you haven't, a paragraph tag
in HTML looks like this:

        <p>This is a paragraph!</p>

    The first tag, `<p>` is an opening tag, and the last tag, `</p>` is a closing
tag. Create a variable that stores the value "This is a paragraph!" and then use
it to construct a new value that represents this snippet of HTML by
concatenating an opening `<p>` tag to the front, and a closing `</p>` tag to the
back.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
	var a="This is a paragraph!";
	console.log("<p>" +'"'+ a +'"'+"</p>")
</script>
	<title></title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
