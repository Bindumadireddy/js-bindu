2. Using the Chrome JavaScript console, practice with string methods. If you
type a string and then the dot operator, and then wait a moment, you'll see that
Chrome's auto-complete box will appear. You can use the up and down arrows to
cycle through all the methods available on the string object. Apply a few of
those methods and see if you can understand what they do.
